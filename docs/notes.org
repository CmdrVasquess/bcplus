In addition to the journal file, which is written incrementally, there
is now (in 2.5) a new file Status.json which is updated every few
seconds, with some information about the current state of the game.
This has a similar format to a line in the journal, but the whole file
is replaced every time. It has a timestamp like the journal, and
"event":"Status" Parameters:

- Flags: multiple flags encoded as bits in an integer (see below)
- Pips: an array of 3 integers representing energy distribution (in
  half-pips)
- Firegroup: the currently selected firegroup number
- GuiFocus: the selected GUI screen
- Latitude (if on or near a planet)
- Altitude
- Longitude
- Heading

Examples:
